# Missionary Meal Scheduler - Complete Setup Guide

This application uses **completely free** notification services (Gmail email and WhatsApp Business API) instead of paid SMS services, making it cost-free to operate. Features include enhanced dietary management, email verification, transfer notifications, and comprehensive missionary information tracking.

## üîß Developer Setup

### 1. Gmail Email Notifications (Recommended - Completely Free)

Gmail notifications work out of the box without any API keys for local development. For production deployment:

1. **Create a Gmail account** (or use existing) for sending notifications
2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on the Gmail account
3. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account Settings ‚Üí Security
   - Under "2-Step Verification", click "App passwords"
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the generated 16-character password

4. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   GMAIL_USER=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

### 2. WhatsApp Business API (Optional - Free Tier Available)

WhatsApp setup is more complex but provides excellent delivery rates:

1. **Create a Facebook Business Account**
2. **Set up WhatsApp Business API**:
   - Go to Facebook Developers Console
   - Create a new app ‚Üí Business ‚Üí WhatsApp
   - Get your Phone Number ID and Access Token

3. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
   WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your-phone-number-id
   WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-custom-webhook-token
   ```

### 3. Database Setup

The application uses PostgreSQL. Run this to update the schema:

```sql
-- Add email and WhatsApp support to missionaries
ALTER TABLE missionaries 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_address TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS whatsapp_number TEXT;

-- Update default notification method to email
ALTER TABLE missionaries 
ALTER COLUMN preferred_notification SET DEFAULT 'email';

-- Update message logs for new notification system
ALTER TABLE message_logs 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS content TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS method TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS estimated_cost TEXT DEFAULT '0';
```

### 4. Environment Variables Summary

**Required for Gmail (Recommended)**:
```bash
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

**Optional for WhatsApp**:
```bash
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your-phone-id
WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-webhook-token
